# Stop hook — refuse to end the turn while the local quality gate is red.
#
# Fires when the main session tries to finish responding. If the source
# tree has pending changes and the toolchain gate is red, it returns
# decision:block so the client continues the turn instead of declaring
# done. The tools themselves are named only in .agentic/toolchain.sh. This makes the review-check discipline automatic: the session
# cannot stop on a broken build without a human seeing green first.
#
# See AGENTS.md -> "Workflow expectations" (Verify).
#
# Stop hooks have no matcher and fire on every turn end, so two guards keep
# this from nagging in normal conversation or looping forever:
#   1. loop guard   — if we are already continuing because of a prior block
#                     (stop_hook_active), step aside with a warning so a gate
#                     that genuinely can't pass surfaces to the human rather
#                     than looping.
#   2. change guard — do nothing if src/ has no pending changes this turn.
#
# decision control: a Stop hook reports its decision via JSON on stdout,
# processed only on exit 0. Both clients accept the same top-level form
# ({"decision":"block","reason":...}), so that is the only shape emitted.
# The Codex wiring passes --codex; the flag is accepted and ignored so
# both wirings can share this script. Emit nothing to allow the stop.
#
# NOT an unbounded guarantee: clients cap or guard repeated continuation.
# This gate is one rung of the
# completion ladder — in-prompt checks below it and a fresh verification
# subagent above it. See WORKFLOW.md -> "The completion ladder".
