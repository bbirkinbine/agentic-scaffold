description: Invoke the reviewer subagent on the complete current semantic change set. Independent review — does not see implementation reasoning.
argument-hint: "[spec-path] [<base>..<head> for an explicit historical range]"
---

Invoke the `reviewer` subagent.

Spec selection:

- Resolve the active spec using `AGENTS.md` → **Shared workflow protocols** →
  **Active-spec resolution**: explicit spec path, then branch-number match,
  then the unique `shipping` spec. Ambiguity stops; never guess from the
  highest spec number.

Change-set selection:

- By default, build the complete pre-commit semantic change set from
  `AGENTS.md` → **Shared workflow protocols** → **Semantic change set**. Pass
  the reviewer the resolved spec path, base ref, merge-base, `git status`
  output, tracked working-tree diff, and untracked-path manifest. The reviewer
  must inspect every untracked path as well as the patch.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` explicitly contains `<base>..<head>`, use that committed
  historical range instead and state that current working-tree changes were
  not reviewed.

The reviewer is fresh and read-only — it has not seen the implementation
reasoning. It checks: spec match, test quality (including tautologies), edge
cases, side effects, don't-touch zones, naming + docstrings, file size,
public-repo hygiene, and docs sync. Pass the recorded `/review-check` evidence;
the read-only reviewer inspects tests and results but does not execute project
code.

Surface its findings verbatim. Do NOT argue with or rationalize away its calls
— if it says "needs to be redone," that's a real signal. The orchestrator may
apply `[auto-fix]` findings; `[ask-user]` stops for human adjudication.

After any fixes, docs affected by the fix are synchronized and the complete
gate runs again. Then invoke a fresh reviewer with the prior findings and the
new complete semantic change set. A focused re-review must verify each claimed
resolution and inspect the fix delta for regressions; if the fix materially
changed design, behavior, or scope, run a full review instead. Do not treat a
green mechanical gate as resolution of a semantic finding.
