# closeout-check — refuse to merge a feature PR whose close-tasks are missing.
#
# The close-tasks rule (AGENTS.md -> Git workflow -> "Close-tasks ride in
# the PR they belong to") says a change's own bookkeeping rides the feature
# branch: the spec's **Status:** flip to shipped, the regenerated
# docs/specs/README.md dashboard, and the AGENTS.md current-state block. The
# rule is explicit and has still been skipped in practice, costing a whole
# extra PR for pure bookkeeping. This is the check that makes it stick.
#
# Runs as a CI job on pull_request, deliberately not as a local pre-push
# hook: close-out is only expected once the work is finished, so blocking
# every intermediate push would train people into `--no-verify`, which is
# how the written rule died in the first place. CI re-runs on each push, so
# close-out that lands late still satisfies it — matching the rule's own
# "committed before the PR is opened (or pushed to the same branch before it
# merges)".
#
# Client-neutral by construction: git and CI are the layers Claude Code and
# Codex share, so neither client can bypass this from its own hooks.
#
# Silent on anything that is not finished spec work: a `<type>/<slug>` chore
# branch, a branch whose number has no spec, or a project that does not use
# docs/specs at all. Each check skips itself rather than inventing a rule.
#
# Branch name comes from $CLOSEOUT_BRANCH, then $GITHUB_HEAD_REF (set by
# GitHub Actions on pull_request, where HEAD is detached), then the current
# branch. Usage: closeout-check.sh [branch-name]
